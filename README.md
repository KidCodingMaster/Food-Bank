# Food Bank
This website was made to help SDG goal number 2 - Zero Hunger, as this website will help people find excess food

## How it works
How this website works is that if you have excess food and you would like to share or donate, for example in a party or a festival, you can click the `I have food` button where you will be directed to a page where you can put in details like title, description, location, and phone number and clicked `Submit`. Then you will  be directed to a page which shows everyone who has excess food, including yours. But if you have food, you can click the button that says `I need food` which redirects you to the page that shows everyone who has excess food
## About
This project was made with Python as backend with Flask. This project was made without AI and was made by me from scratch from idea to project.

## Notes by the developer
I hope this project will help the world and make it a better place and solve world hunger.
